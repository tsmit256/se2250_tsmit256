This course used C# as the language and Unity as the graphics platform.

Improved my own software development practises as well as improved other aspects of project management such as learning time-management,
planning, and quality control.

Topics covered in this course included an introduction to Software development process, basic process models, 
software specification, introduction to software design, programming language specifics (C#),
