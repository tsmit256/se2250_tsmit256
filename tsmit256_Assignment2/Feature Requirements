Created a simple 3D game where a player collects cubes by rolling a ball. 
Red ball represents a player and the cubes represent the pickup objects. 

Feature Requirements:
1. The player rolls the ball within the box by pressing the arrow keys.
2. When the ball hits the wall of the box, it should bounce back like a real ball rolled against the wall.
3. The ball must remain in the box and not bounce out of the box.
4. Eight or more pickup objects (squares in the figure) should be located just above the box. They should differ in colour.
5. All pickup objects should be created from the script
6. There should only be one pickup asset in the project.
7. When the ball hits a pickup object, the pickup object must disappear and the score must increase.
8. Display the score in the upper right corner.
9. Collecting different colour cubes must result in different point gains. 
10. Use ‘property’ to handle points for pickup object.
